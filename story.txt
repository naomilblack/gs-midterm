Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named Kai-Yun
and his trusty band of ninja monkeys. The monkeys wanted some bananas so bad that they were willing to steal from the Not-So-Immortal Josh-Yun.
The monkeys didnâ€™t realize the Josh-Yun had anticipated their thievery and had laced the bananas with a psychedelic fungi. 
The monkeys began to hallucinate and saw Josh-Yun gather with his own army of ninja cats ready for battle. 
The monkeys thought it was a dream, but was it? Where was Kai-Yun? Find out on the next episode of Crazy Animal Ninjas in Shangri-La. 

Previously on Crazy Animal Ninjas in Shangri-La, the monkeys hallucinated and fought some (imaginary) Ninja Cats. When they came to, 
Kai-Yun was standing there, furious and dissappointed. He needed to punish the monkeys.

Kai-Yun decided on a fitting punishment for the monkeys.  The monkeys would be locked in a magic cave where they would need to figure out an exact combination of crystals to activate in order to get out.
