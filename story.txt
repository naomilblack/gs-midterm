Once upon a time in the mystical land of Downtown Detroit there dwelt an immortal named David
and his trusty band of students. The students wanted some bananas so bad that they were willing to steal from the Not-So-Immortal Josh-Yun.
The students didn’t realize the Josh-Yun had anticipated their thievery and had laced the bananas with a psychedelic fungi. 
The students began to hallucinate and saw Josh-Yun gather with his own army of ninja cats ready for battle. 
The students thought it was a dream, but was it? Where was David? Find out on the next episode of Crazy Students in Downtown Detroit. 

Previously on Crazy Students in Downtown Detroit, the monkeys hallucinated and fought some (imaginary) Ninja Cats. When they came to, 
David was standing there, furious and disappointed. He needed to punish the students.

David decided on a fitting punishment for the students.  The students would be locked in a magic cave where they
would need to figure out an exact combination of crystals to activate in order to get out.
