Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named Kai-Yun
and his trusty band of ninja monkeys. The monkeys wanted some bananas so bad that they were willing to steal from the Not-So-Immortal Josh-Yun.
The monkeys didnâ€™t realize the Josh-Yun had anticipated their thievery and had laced the bananas with a psychedelic fungi.
